### Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is Luke Piper, and I'm a 19 year-old computer science student at Otago University.

This GitHub profile is dedicated to showcasing some of the projects I have worked on since I started coding. These projects have helped teach me valuable skills in many different languages.
